  - quote: He had reached out and our house was under contract and that contract expired before it sold. He had reached out, I was happy with the terms of the contract, and felt confident going forward with him. Also, he was successful in selling it. His assistant was excellent, took care of all the different aspects, closing, they were very responsive and easy to work with for sure. As a team they were great! He is responsive, trustworthy, knows how to showcase a house in the right way and also very effective.

  - quote: I moved to Colorado in the middle of September. We decided to bring my son in law down there to make sure he wanted to live there. We looked around and saw his name on a house. We called about it and we moved in like a month later. He is great, he was always friendly and calls often to see how we are doing. He always sends stuff in the mail for free dinners and stuff like that. He is the best. He is so sweet and kind, and he tells you the truth. That is the main thing I like.

  - quote: He was top notch. He was very professional. They did everything they said they would do and more. He kept us informed every step of the way, so no complaints at all. So yeah, it would be like I said, keeping us informed... Several times I had questions and stuff, and I would get a call at 7 or 8 at night just to make sure I knew what was going on and what we needed to do.

  - quote: Excellent. He was always there for us, called us, communicated in the evening whenever necessary. Took care of us great. Just the mannerism where he would, we initially sat down with him to talk about that he really wasn't pressured, he was just so relaxed and calm. "Yes, if this is what you want to do, would this time-frame work for you, here would be your possible next step, how do you feel about that?" You know, just very informative but not pushy, do you know what I mean? Sometimes, when we had talked to a couple other Realtors, you almost felt like you were being pounced on so to speak. He was there to be serious about the business but no pressure. "Will this work for you?" "What do you think? "I'm here for you" kind of guy. "If you want me but hey."

  - quote: “It was great. In fact, Jeff has the most fantastic assistant, Jessica. She is amazing. She always kept me informed and then Jeff would follow up a couple of times a week. This is the fourth transaction I’ve done with Jeff. I keep coming back to him because he is awesome. In my situation, the condo that I was buying the owner took the flooring out. It was touch and go because the appraiser didn’t want to appraise the property with out flooring. The Jeff Ryder team really went out of their way to make sure that the property closed when it was supposed to and that there were no issues regarding the flooring situation. I was able to get in and put in the flooring that I wanted.”

  - quote: We discussed pricing and marketing conditions and then Jeff came up with a sell-able price which we were happy with. We sold it in 6 weeks and before we had it with Jeff, it was on the market for 2 years so he did really well! We was particularly impressed with his team and we saw Jeff in every aspect of the transaction. It just speaks to his good management skills!
