There’s normally a 30- to 45-day time frame for the buyer to do their due diligence. It also gives the bank time to get their paperwork in order. Basically, “pending” means the sale is “pending to close.”<br /><br /><b>Sold</b>: If you see a “sold” sign in front of a house, that means the property has already closed—it’s already changed hands, the deed’s been signed, the title work is done, and the new owner is probably in the process of moving in.<br /><div><br /></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-left">“</span></span></span><br /><div class="quote-text"><span id="docs-internal-guid-337dfad8-be93-0ec6-eb09-ebe3bd4353d1"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once you become a client, we start fighting for you.</span></span></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-right">”</span></span></span></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>MLS</b>: This acronym stands for “multiple listing service,” which is the system us agents use to search and reference any and all active properties in the market.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>Client</b>: Or more specifically, what’s the difference between a client and a customer? You become a client once you fill out paperwork with us and we’ve fully disclosed our service relationship to you. A customer, on the other hand, is someone who’s just walked into an open house and is still in their home search phase. At that point, we don’t have any fiduciary rights to that person and don’t represent them in any way, shape, or form.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you have any questions about these terms or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our area, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;</span><br /><div><br /></div>
