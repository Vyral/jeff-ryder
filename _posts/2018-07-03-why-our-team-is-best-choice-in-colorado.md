I wanted to take a moment to answer a question I hear a lot. “There are almost 5,000 real estate agents in Colorado Springs. Why should I hire your team?” This is a really good question, so I want to give you a few really good answers.

The first reason you should hire our team is because of our experience. I’ve been involved in the sale of over 1,200 homes in the past 16 years and during this time, the real estate market has changed a lot. Prices and sales went from extreme highs to extreme lows and back again. When the market changes, we change with it to help our clients navigate the challenges they face when purchasing or selling a home.

I don’t do it alone, however. To really get great results for our clients, it takes a whole team. We have a great one. When you hire us, you get a team of professionals working for you for the price of one.

Another great reason to hire us is because of our flexible and innovative programs designed to maximize the equity in your home. For example, our common sense listing program offers flexible commissions, the right to sell your house yourself and pay nothing, and the right to fire us at any time if you aren’t happy. You can even list your house with us for a dollar with our "dollar listing plan," when you move up to a new home. These are just a few of our innovative programs created with our clients’ best interest in mind.

Finally, you should hire us because of the team behind our team. Keller Williams is the largest real estate company in the world for the number of agents and the number of homes sold. Their technology, training, and resources are unmatched.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home or know somebody who is, remember that our experience, our flexible and creative programs, and our company and team-wide support is what we have to offer.

If you have any questions or want to learn more, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
