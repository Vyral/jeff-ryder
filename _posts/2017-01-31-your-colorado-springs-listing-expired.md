Like most markets in the country, the Colorado Springs market has been pretty hot for awhile now. Prices and sales are up, but inventory and interest rates remain low. Because of this, most homes on the market sell pretty quickly. What if your house wasn’t one of those? What if it became an expired listing?

There are a few small adjustments you can make to help you sell it.

When a home doesn’t sell, the homeowner usually does one of three things. They either re-list with the same agent to get the same results, or they may decide to either rent it or keep it. If your home won’t sell and it’s frustrating you, you need to bring me out to take a look at it. Many times, all it takes is a small adjustment to the approach of selling it.

I specialize in helping homeowners sell homes that didn’t sell the first time. If you check out the video above, you can see some examples of houses that didn’t sell.

One sat on the market for 59 days with no offers. The photos of the home were a bit dark and made the rooms looks small. So, we came in with our professional photographer and also made some staging adjustments. The house, in turn, sold in four days for more than $2,000 above list price.

Even in the best markets, some homes just don’t sell. So let my team of experts take a look at it and help you go from a ‘shown’ to a ‘sold.’

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email soon. We look forward to helping you!
