Here are six tips that will help you prepare your home for the winter season. These tips will not only save you money, but they’ll also improve the quality of your home:

**1\. Check your furnace filter.** The standard rule of thumb is to change your filter every month during the summer and every three months during winter. A new filter costs just $3, and buying cheaper actually helps you in the long run because, as I’ve been told by HVAC professionals, cheaper filters allow more airflow.&nbsp;

**2\. Hire a professional to check your furnace.** If it hasn’t been inspected in the last 12 months, now’s the perfect time to have it cleaned, serviced, and certified. It’s also important to check if your furnace is leaking carbon monoxide, which, obviously, can be dangerous. As Mark Thernes of Springs Heating & Cooling explains in the video above, it’s a lot harder to schedule a service appointment in December in case of an emergency, so you’re better off doing it now.&nbsp;

**3\. Clean your gutters.** Make sure they’re free of any debris and water runs smoothly through them and away from your foundation.&nbsp;

**4\. Turn off any exterior faucets and disconnect your hoses.** Sitting water can cause cracks in pipes and cause major issues down the road.&nbsp;

**5\. Take the bag off your lawnmower and mow over any fallen leaves.** Mulching leaves across your yard is good for the soil.&nbsp;

**6\. Reverse your ceiling fans.** We all know hot air rises, so if you reverse your ceiling fans, it will cause air to disperse more evenly and help you save on heating costs.&nbsp;
