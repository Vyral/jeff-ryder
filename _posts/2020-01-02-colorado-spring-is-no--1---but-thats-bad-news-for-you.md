Want to buy a home in Colorado Springs? Get in line.&nbsp;

According to a report from the National Association of Realtors that polled 400 different communities, we ranked as the most difficult place to buy a home. This same report said that 11.1% of the people who live here are either actively looking for a house or are thinking of making a move sometime soon. What makes this situation challenging is that Colorado Springs is ranked very low in terms of difficulty for home sellers.

This report verifies what Realtors like myself have known for years. **A lot of people keep moving here, which is creating high demand, but there isn’t enough inventory.** The buyers who are looking in the $300,000 and under price range are struggling.&nbsp;

What does this mean? If you’re a homeowner, just sit back and enjoy the ride—you’re gaining equity daily. If you’re a buyer, give my team a call. We don’t promise miracles, but we have a lot of creative options that can get your offer accepted over the competition’s.&nbsp;
