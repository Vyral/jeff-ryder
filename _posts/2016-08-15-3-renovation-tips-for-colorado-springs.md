You’ve heard me say many times that now is a great time to be in the real estate market. When most people want to maximize the money they get out of their home sale, they start renovating their property. However, there are a few pitfalls you should keep in mind before you renovate your home.

For many homeowners, selling is something you may only do once or twice in your lifetime. I recommend consulting with the professionals if you are thinking about doing major changes to your house. If you are making those renovations for you and your family to enjoy, you don’t have to worry too much. If you are selling your home soon, though, definitely check in with a real estate professional before you do anything.

Here are three main reasons why you should consult with a professional:

**1. New owners may not have the same taste as you.** Though there are a few clean-slate-type designs that may seem universally pleasing, you never know how a potential buyer might react. Aside from painting in neutral colors and modernizing kitchens and bathrooms, generally speaking, less is more when it comes to renovations.

**2. The value of your house may already be topped off.** Depending on the market you’re in, your home may already be at its maximum home value limit. If the value of your home is already significantly higher than other homes in your neighborhood, dumping money into renovations could be a huge waste.

**3. You will run into hidden costs while renovating.** The last thing you want to do is open a can of worms that will cost you a lot of money. You may run into issues hidden behind the walls. No matter your budget, most homeowners run into problems that end up costing a lot more money than they expected.

If you have any questions, I can help you figure out which home renovations will bring you the most return on investment. I can also put you in touch with great contractors, electricians, and more to help you with any updates you need.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
