It’s time for another edition of the Ryder Real Estate Report. Do you hear the knocking sound at your door? It’s the sound of homebuyers lining up to purchase your home.&nbsp;

**Although conventional wisdom says that the winter isn’t the best time to sell a home, we’re bucking the trend right now in Colorado.** According to a senior economist from Realtor.com, sellers tend to be more reluctant to list during the colder time of year when the market has a seasonal slowdown.

However, a recent report from Showing Time says that’s not true right now. They say that the nation’s 12.6% growth in home showings compared to 2018 was **the most significant jump in buyer traffic during the current four-month streak of year-over-year increases.** The western region saw the greatest growth of activity with a 23% jump in the showing index. A lot of people are out looking at homes right now, as you can see.

**The bottom line is that waiting until later in the spring to sell might not be the best move this year.** There are people out there looking right now for a home like yours. If you want to learn more about why this might be the perfect time for you to list your home for sale, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
