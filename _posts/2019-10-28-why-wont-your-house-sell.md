As with most areas around the country, real estate in Colorado Springs is hot\! **Homes have been selling at record pace** and continue to do so. Inventory and interest rates remain low, and demand for homes is high. So, most homes are selling.&nbsp;

However, what if your home isn’t one of them? What if your home became an expired listing? Today we’ll discuss what to do if your house is not selling. I’ll show you how you can go from being a “shown” to a “sold\!”

When a home doesn’t sell, a homeowner usually does one of two things. One, they may elect to list it with the same agent, who performs the same actions, and gets the same result. In other words, it doesn’t sell. Or two, a homeowner may choose to rent out the house. However, if you like your home more than anyone else and you want to hang onto it, that’s fine.&nbsp;

If you’re frustrated with everyone else’s home on the street selling and yours not, you should allow me to look at it. I specialize in selling homes that didn’t sell the first time. **Often it takes just a few modest modifications to make all the difference** in the world. At 1:05 in the video above, watch to see a few examples of homes that didn’t sell right away, but with our adjustments sold quickly.&nbsp;

Even in strong markets some homes don’t sell. If you’re one of them, don’t feel bad. Just give me a call and have me take a look at it. Have an expert who assists people whose homes didn’t sell the first time, get it sold.&nbsp;

If you have any further questions about why your home didn’t sell or anything else concerning real estate, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would love to help you\!
