There are two things that buyers want to have in a home, even in a competitive market like this. Here’s what they are.

You’ve been hearing me say for a while that the market is crazy with low inventory and high demand. Well, surprise\! That’s still the case today.&nbsp;

In this kind of market, buyers have to make some sacrifices, maybe in the form of one less bedroom than they wanted or being in a different area of town. However, there are two things, according to a report by the National Association of Homebuilders, that buyers don’t want to give up.

**The first is a garage.** 64% of new homes offer a two-car garage, 21% of these homes have a garage large enough to hold three or more cars, and 7% have a one-car garage.

**Buyers don’t want to give up their patios either.** Out of roughly 876,000 single-family homes that were built in 2018, 64% of them came with patios. That’s the highest percentage we’ve seen from the NAHB since they started tracking the number.&nbsp;

In the graph at 1:55 in the video above, you can see that the number of new homes built with patios has increased every year for the past nine years.

The bottom line is that homebuyers are looking for these two specific features in a home. **You can get a little extra bump in your sale price if you have a garage, patio, or both.&nbsp;**

If you have the kind of home that buyers are looking for today and you want to sell for top dollar or you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you.
