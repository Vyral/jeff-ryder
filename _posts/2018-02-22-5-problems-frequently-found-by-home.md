So you’ve decided to sell your home and, before you know it, it goes under contract. Before the deal can close, though, you’ve got to pass a home inspection.

A home inspection contingency is present in most real estate contracts to allow the buyer to back out should any major issues become apparent. It’s at this stage that many deals fall through. So, with so much at stake, it just makes sense to thoroughly prepare your property in advance. Making these preparations will save you a lot of negotiation and repair work down the road.

The following areas are where unpleasant surprises often arise and, ultimately, either kill the sale or cost the seller a lot of money:
**1. The roof.** Repairs to the roof can be very expensive. If you think your home may need a new roof, consider taking care of it before listing your property on the market. With all the hail damage we get in our area, these repairs might be covered by your insurance.
**2. The heating and cooling system.** Regardless of the season, a home inspector will want to make sure the heating and cooling systems are in good shape. I highly advise hiring a professional prior to your inspection to uncover any issues beforehand.
**3. Electrical issues.** Making sure your electrical systems are up-to-code before the inspection is critical because electrical violations are both common and easy to spot. Also, faulty wiring is a fire hazard. The sooner you address these issues, the safer your home will be.
**4. The plumbing.** Plumbing problems can cause your deal to go down the drain. So, never put these issues off.
**5. Water damage.** Even if you don’t have an active leak, stains on ceilings are often signs of previous problems. Though this past issue may have been as harmless as an overflowing toilet, buyers will suspect the worst if they see signs of water damage. Always fix any current leaks in your home and cover signs of previous ones.

So, if you plan on selling your home, you may want to consider having a pre-inspection performed. This can help uncover any of the issues we’ve discussed today.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
