If you are buying a home, you need to have it inspected by a professional home inspector.

Today, I’ll show you how you can get a free home inspection (including a radon test and sewer scope). First, I want to explain why it’s so important to get one in the first place. Brody Lotz, the co-owner of American Professional Home Inspection, is here to help.

So, why is an inspection so important?

The main thing is that when you buy a home, especially as a first-time buyer, you are making one of the biggest investments of your life. You want peace of mind. You don’t want to walk into a bad situation or money pit. Inspectors like Brody look at things to protect your investment.

What major components are covered in a home inspection?

The most important things inspectors look for are structural issues. “We check the roof for leaks and look at plumbing, electrical, and, of course, the foundation,” says Brody. “We really pay attention to big-ticket safety items. We also look at your appliances like the water heater and the furnace, which could be a big deal down the road.” Your inspector is there to make sure you are protected.

What is radon and why do you need to test for it?

Radon is present everywhere in the air, but it tends to accumulate in basements. Radon is a radioactive gas that dissipates in the air, but radon levels can rise in your home. If the house does have high levels of radon, it can be mitigated.

Now, in my opinion, it’s also very important to check the sewer line. I’ve heard a lot of horror stories out there where someone buys a house, the sewer line collapses, and the basement is flooded with sewage. Not all homes need a sewer line inspection, though. According to Brody, he determines that on a case by case basis.

It all depends on what kind of drain pipes there are, how old the home is, and if there are a lot of trees in the front yard. Those are all major concerns. If Brody can determine what the pipes are made out of, that can help determine whether or not the property needs a sewer line inspection.

If the sewer line collapses after you buy the house, that’s automatically a $10,000 to $15,000 fix. You can protect yourself from that by paying a much smaller amount for a home inspection.

Now, I have a home inspection certificate valued at $600. If you are the first buyer to contact me, I will pay for your inspection, as well as your radon and sewer line tests.

I want to go above and beyond that, so here’s my next offer: If you buy a house with me before the end of 2017, I will pay for your home inspection to make sure you are protected when making such a big investment.
