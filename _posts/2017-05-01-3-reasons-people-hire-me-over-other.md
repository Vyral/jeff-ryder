There are three reasons you should hire me to help you sell your home over all the other agents in town.

Today I want to answer a question that I get asked a lot: “Jeff, there are 3,000 real estate agents in this town. Why should I pick you?” There are three answers I can provide:

**1. I’m a highly experienced professional.** Everybody knows that the market is hot right now. When that happens, a lot of people get into real estate. The person that changed the tires on your car last month could be your Realtor tomorrow. The person you’re interviewing right now to handle your largest financial asset could also have a part-time job at Dillard’s.

You have to make sure the person you hire is a full-time, committed professional. I’ve been doing this for more than 15 years and have sold more than 1,000 homes. There are very few scenarios I haven’t seen. This is important because I can predict any issues in advance so we can eliminate them and make your transaction as smooth as possible. The market has changed a lot in those 15 years—it’s gone up, then down, and now it’s back up again. It’s changed, and so have I.

**2. My common sense listing system.** A lot of Realtors put you in the same system but my team has got a lot of flexibility. We offer flexible commissions and the right to sell your house by yourself while it’s listed with me and pay nothing. After all the advertising we do and the buyers we bring to your house, you still have the option to fire me. I don’t think you’re going to do that though, and that’s because of reason No. 3.

**3. The results we get.** The team I have and the company I work for will get you better results and provide you with better service, period. RE/MAX Properties is the No. 1 company in town. Since 1989, they’ve sold more homes than any other company. Right now, one out of every six houses in this city is listed with us.

These are factors you should look for in any agent you hire, but my experience, my team’s flexibility, and the company I work for will get you the results you want. Whether you’re thinking about selling or buying a house, feel free to call me or send me an email. I’d be happy to assist you and get you the results you’re looking for.
