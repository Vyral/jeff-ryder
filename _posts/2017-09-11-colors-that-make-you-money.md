Most people have heard that you should stick with neutral colors when painting your home before a sale. However, a new study shows that this may no longer be the case.

Did you know that you could add thousands to the value of your home by spending less than $100?

We’ve all heard that neutral paint colors are best for your home. However, a recent study from Money Magazine now indicates that you may want to go with something a little bolder.

The study included more than 32,000 photos of homes, and the results showed that certain colors in certain rooms can increase the value of your home by more than $5,000.

Homes with blue or gray-blue kitchens sold for about $1,800 more. A lot of white in a kitchen can also help it to appear cleaner.

In a smaller room like a bathroom, an accent wall is going to give you much more bang for your buck. Powder blue and periwinkle are very popular colors for bathrooms.

Homes with bold shades of blue also tend to boost home value. Dining rooms look good in slate blue or pale gray, while living rooms generally benefit from a light beige or pale taupe.

On the exterior of the home, a navy blue front door can really make the house pop.

I’m not an interior decorator or a stager, but I am connected with a team of professionals who can help you sell your home for the most money with simple tips like this.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
